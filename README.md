# Zygote

In biology, the [zygote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zygote) is the earliest
developmental stage. This project also represents the first stage of development
for [Toit](https://toitlang.org)-based projects that need to provide WiFi-based
services that can be deployed on production devices and configured by the
end-user.
